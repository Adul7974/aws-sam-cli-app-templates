# Cookiecutter Python Hello-world for CDK based Serverless App

A cookiecutter template to create a Python Hello world boilerplate using [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk).
The cdk project is written by Python.

## Requirements

* [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)

## Usage

Generate a boilerplate template in your current project directory using the following syntax:

* **Python3.8**: `sam init --project-type cdk --cdk-language python --runtime python3.8`

> **NOTE**: ``--name`` allows you to specify a different project folder name, and the app name (`sam-app` is the default)

# Credits
